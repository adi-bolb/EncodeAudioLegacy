#Encode Audio Legacy
Your are involve in a new project called encode audio. As this project starts to be to diffcult to maintain and evolve and you are the expert, you are in charge to refactor it. As a craftmanship, you decide to start by writins unit tests in order to reach 100% code coverage. But as usual, you have few time to do it : 4 hours max.

The futur of the project is in your hand. Good luck!

# Step 1: Method returns a primitive type 
Now it's time to start our job! As a craftman, we will work by baby steps.<br>
This step is aimed to coverage method that returns a primitive type. 

Write a unit test that reach ~100% code coverage. 
# Step 2: TODO 
TODO...

# Time keeper
You have 15 minutes!

##Acceptance tests
At the end of this step:


##Hints
- Create a second test with an REMOTE\_AUDIO\_FILE\_NAME that does not exist.
