#Encode Audio Legacy
Your are involve in a new project called encode audio. As this project starts to be to diffcult to maintain and evolve and you are the expert, you are in charge to refactor it. As a craftmanship, you decide to start by writins unit tests in order to reach 100% code coverage. But as usual, you have few time to do it : 4 hours max.

The futur of the project is in your hand. Good luck!

# Step 0: first steps 
In order to reduce the complexity, you start with a simplify version of the project. First, take a look of the legacy code and try to understand what it is doing. 

Then initialize you environnement in order to be able to build the project, launch a unit test, have a look to the code coverage.

# Time keeper
You have 15 minutes!

##Acceptance tests
At the end of this step:

1. I am able to build the project
2. I can launch a unit test (red then green)
3. I can see the code coverage
