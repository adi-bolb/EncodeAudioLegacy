By varying the inputs you should be able to cover all but one catch clause in CoreUtil.\r\n\r\n### Hints: \r\nThere are 3 arguments that vary\r\n\r\nthere are files in src/test/resources that are used in the tests. You could add more of them, you could misspell a name.\r\n\r\n##Acceptance tests\r\n1. There is only one test method\r\n2. All branches (except IOException in CoreUtil)  are covered\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
